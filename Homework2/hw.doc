Problem #2
	First 12 coordinates:
		(3,5)
		(3,6)
		(3,4)
		(2,4)
		(1,4)
		(1,3)
		(1,2)
		(1,1)
		(2,1)
		(3,3)
		(4,5)
		(5,5)

Problem #4
	First 12 coordinates:
		(3,5)
		(4,5)
		(3,4)
		(3,6)
		(5,5)
		(3,3)
		(2,4)
		(6,5)
		(5,4)
		(1,4)
		(7,5)
		(5,3)

		Problem 1 uses a stack to store coordinates, while Problem 3 uses a queue. Stacks follow a Last In, First Out method of removing coordinates, so the program traverses through an entire path before starting a new path. Queues follow a First In, First Out method, so the program starts each path but doesn't traverse through all of them in entirety.
